- an online repository for code.
- [bought by Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17422788/microsoft-github-acquisition-official-deal) in 2018, which eventually led to controversial products like [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

✔️ In-Class Exercise

1. Create a [Github account](https://github.com). If you already have one, great! 
2. Download and install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). If you already use Git, that's fine too!
3. Once installed, launch the Github Desktop and sign in.

PAUSE
>We will create a Github folder on our computer to store our work in.
4. Choose "Create a new repository on your hard drive..."
5. In the next dialog box, do the following:
    - **Name**: this will be where you keep your classwork, so choose a name that relates to the class, like "recode-assignments" or whatever.
    - **Description**: something that makes sense or leave it blank
    - **Local Path**: wherever you keep your class work on your local hard drive. This folder should not take up a lot of your space.
    - **Initialize with a README**: ✅
    - **Git ignore**: ❌
    - **License**: ❌
6. Once the repo is created, click "Publish Repository" which will bring up a dialog. Make sure that "Keep this code private" is unchecked before proceeding so that I can see the code later when you share the link.
7. Once published, you can visit the repo at https://github.com/username/reponame/ where `username` is your username and `reponame` is the name you just gave the repo when you created it using Github Desktop.

## What is Github anyways...

Github is a repository for code. We will be using it as a place to share the code we have written locally on our machine with one another. So there will be a process of writing code locally and then `pushing` that code to Github. 

>There is an intermediary step before the push is made called a `commit`. It's sort of like saving a file on your computer, but a commit gives you a way to make notes about the changes you have made along the way. *And only the changes that have been committed will be pushed*. But we'll talk more about this as time goes on!

### How to publish an assignment on Github

1. Go to your local repo folder and create a new folder there called "01-foundations" for Assignment 1. This is where you will place your `about-me.html` page or whatever you have named your page.
>Remember that before you can push or publish your code to Github, you have to commit that code locally using Github Desktop.
2. You can publish the changes to your repo and share the link to your code. Your link will look like this - https://github.com/your-user-name/your-repo-name/01-foundations/about-me.html
