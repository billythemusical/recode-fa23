# <h>Pre-Requisites</h>

Creative Coding is a requirement to take this class. Certain exceptions can be made if a student can demonstrate proficiency or for other certain circumstances.

# <h>Course Objectives</h>

Students in this course will:
- Further their knowledge and understanding of p5.js and Javascript
- Understand "vanilla" Javascript and how it operates inside and outside of the web browser
- Understand how HTML and CSS relate to Javascript and operate on their own
- Deconstruct and dissect creative coding sketches with paper and pen and discuss the techniques that interest them the most
- Work to identify the values that they possess and imbue those values into the algorithms that permeate their work
- Develop code in a local environment and move that code online  
- Discover and explore open-source code libraries and include these external libraries in their work
- Learn best practices for using Large Language Models (LLM's) as coding assistants and for debugging
- Understand basic server/client architecture and write backend code using Node.js
- Build their own stand-alone Progressive Web Applications (PWA's) which can be installed in desktop and mobile platforms and run offline

> Note: <b>*</b> indicates a module that last two weeks.

# <h>Grading Policy</h>

**Assignments - 60%**

- Usually, there will be one assignment at the end of each learning module, of which there will be 10. The lowest one will be dropped at the end.

**Reading & Writing - 20%**  

- Reading will be regularly assigned with a written response in the form of a blog post. Collectively, these are worth 20% of your grade.  Either you did it, you did it well (bonus points perhaps), or you didn't do it at all.

**Class Participation - 20%**  

- Class participation includes taking part in class discussion and exercises, asking questions, and communicating reliably with the professor.  

# <h>Grading Methodology</h>  

Assignments are a chance for you to demonstrate you understanding of the material and for you to have a creative outlet for your work that you would want to be a part of your creative portfolio. You will be graded on how well you satisfy the constraints of the assignment with special attention given to creativity and the attention to detail. And please note the role that documentation plays here. Exceptional output should be accompanied with exceptional documentation and conceptual explanation.

This is in line with the idea of a labor-based grading system, where the emphasis is not simply placed solely on the "right answer," but how much effort the student has put into making progress. This includes documenting one's process, including any errors encountered along the way, which benefits those in the class as well as the community at large.

So even if you are struggling with "getting it to work," I want to see that you are taking advantage of the resources available to you, are making good use of your time and are communicative where you are finding difficulty. I don't think any student's grade should suffer because they are not getting the help they need!

# <h>Assignments</h>

> Turn in your assignments on [this Google form](https://forms.gle/qFmdmwFxJA1Jccs16). 

Specific requirements for assignments:

- In addition to the code, you assignment should include documentation of your process in fulfilling the assignment's objectives.  

- You'll need somewhere to upload your completed sketches.  At times, we will use the p5 web editor for this.  For later assignments, you may already have your own web hosting service, like [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).  If not, I'll show you how to set a [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) account in class.  

- Assignments must be turned in *before class* on the day they're due. Late assignments will not be accepted.  

- Assignments will be graded on their technical mastery and creativity. Occasionally, and as time permits, we'll be critiquing student work in-class, generally in an informal way and on a volunteer basis.

# <h> Attendance Policy </h>  

I will take attendance throughout the semester on a regular basis. The university also has clear policies on what to do in the case of illness or excused absences. Please refer to their policies as outlined below. 

You are allowed up to **three (3) unexcused absences** throughout the semester, but you are responsible for making up any course work or assignments that you miss. You may use drop-in hours for this purpose. For each unexcused absence beyond three, you will begin to drop a letter grade per absence, so please communicate with me before this takes place.

In regards to tardiness, please notify me immediately if you will have issues getting to 370 Jay St. on time. If you are more than 15 minutes late, you will be counted absent for the day.

# <h> ITP/IMA Code of Conduct </h>

Let's take a minute to discuss the [ITP/IMA Code of Conduct](https://itpnyu.github.io/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct/community_statement). This important information will inform much of how we conduct ourselves in the classroom in how we approach our work and one another as well as the context in which we find ourselves.

### Textbooks  

This class does not have an official textbook, although a number of assignments will come from the following texts which are freely available in digital or physical form at the NYU Library:

- *Generative Design: Visualize, Program, and Create with Javascript in p5.js* by Benedikt Groß, Hartmut Bohnacker, Julia Laub, and Claudius Lazzeroni  
    - ([NYU Library link](https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/1c17uag/nyu_aleph007590222) or [for purchase](https://www.amazon.com/Generative-Design-Visualize-Program-JavaScript/dp/1616897589))

Here is also a great reference text from the creators of p5.js and Processing, respectively:

- [Make: Getting Started with p5.js: Making Interactive Graphics in JavaScript and Processing](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Interactive-Graphics-JavaScript-Processing/dp/1457186772/), by Lauren McCarthy, Ben Fry, and Casey Reas

### On The Web  

What's great about *Code as a Creative Medium* and *Generative Design* is that they have online components with code examples that you can explore:

- [link to generative design website](https://github.com/jediahkatz/generative-design)  
- [link to code as a creative medium github](https://github.com/CodeAsCreativeMedium)

Here are a number of handy resources we will be using throughout the class:  

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [W3 Schools Javascript Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript)
- [Open Processing](openprocessing.org)
- [Creative Coding Courses](https://github.com/terkelg/awesome-creative-coding)

I know some others of you have also expressed interest in learning other languages.  I can certainly vouch for [this Google tutorial](https://developers.google.com/edu/python) on learning Python.
