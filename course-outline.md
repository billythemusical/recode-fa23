## Module 1 - Foundations 

Welcome, everyone, to the class! Let's first introduce ourselves. Then we will go over the syllabus, course outline, how to use the class website, how to contact me and our GA (if applicable), drop-in hours, etc.

Topics:
- [What is Javascript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)
- Why Javascript?
    - It's the language of the internet, browsers, etc.
    - It's interactive (IMA, after all)
    - It's forgiving and easy to begin with, but also versatile and powerful, as we'll dig into
    - ... and p5.js, of course!
- So what is p5.js anyways?
    - I love Allison Parrish's tutorials for all things, but [this introduction]((https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/first-steps/)) to p5.js is great.
